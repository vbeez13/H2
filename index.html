        I know life gets heavy sometimes. So I made this little something to remind you you are not alone. You are on someone mind(meüòó) all the time. 
        I know the last time it made you smile maybe this will too. This little message is my way of showing you just how much you mean to me

I know you are going through something tough right now, and please believe me when I say you‚Äôve never been a burden to me.  
It is honestly my pleasure to make you smile like when I made that little confession website for you.  
I love doing these small things just to see you happy.  
And it means the world when you like them and send those sweet messages showing how much you appreciate it.  
You deserve all the smiles always üòá.
</p>

<p>
Whenever life feels heavy just know I am here cheering for you and ready with a smile whenever you need it.  
I am just a call or message away.  
I wish I was closer to you right now so I could come over cheer you up and help take your mind off everything.  
I would do whatever it takes to see you smile and relax, because you deserve to feel happy and carefree just like the lovely amazing Habibi you areü§ê.
</p>

<p>
Until then know that I am always here for you even from a distance.  
Whenever you need someone to listen & to laugh with or just to be there quietly i am just behind my phone waiting for you, ready to brighten your day in any way I can.
And do not forget you have got a smile that can brighten up even on the worst day.  So keep shining because I need that beautiful smile only you can give.

        Sometimes the smallest moments a kind word, a smile a small act or just knowing someone cares can make a biggest difference.  
So whenever you need a little boost remember I am here ready to share those moments with you no matter the distance.

From the very beginning, I was attracted to who you are  funny, someone I can completely vibe with, someone I feel comfortable around, someone who can say the worst jokes and still end up making me  laugh  You that perfect mix of sweet and ‚Äúsauvagerie‚Äù and honestly, it is what makes you so special to me.
</p>
   <p>
      I am grateful for the joy you bring into my life. In the time we have known each other you have become a significant part of my world.  I cannot go a day without talking to you.  You are constantly on my mind like 24/7. Every notification i hope it is you and when it is i have a big smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have often thought about how a future with you would look like. I imagine a home filled with love, laughter, lot of sovagerieü´£ and the shared pursuit of happiness. As I write this I realize that no amount of words can fully express the depth of my feelings for you. But I hope you can see the sincerity in my heart and the love that spills out with every word. You are my heart‚Äôs truest desire. 
      </p>
